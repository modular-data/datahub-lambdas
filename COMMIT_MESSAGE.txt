fix: Upgrade OWASP Dependency Check to 10.0.4 for NVD API 2.0 support

## Problem
CircleCI pipeline failing with 403 Forbidden errors during OWASP dependency check:

```
Error retrieving https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-modified.meta; 
received response code 403; Forbidden
```

## Root Cause
- NVD (National Vulnerability Database) deprecated and shut down the legacy 
  JSON 1.1 data feeds in December 2023
- Project was using OWASP Dependency Check v8.2.1 which only supports the 
  deprecated feeds
- NVD now requires using their API 2.0 instead of the old data feeds
- OWASP versions prior to 10.0.2 are no longer supported

## Solution
1. Upgraded OWASP Dependency Check plugin from 8.2.1 to 10.0.4
2. Added NVD API key configuration to support the new API 2.0
3. Configured CVSS threshold to fail build on score >= 7 (HIGH/CRITICAL)
4. Created documentation for team reference

## Changes Made
- `build.gradle`:
  - Updated plugin version from 8.2.1 to 10.0.4 (line 6)
  - Added dependencyCheck configuration block (lines 144-155)
  - Configured NVD API key support via environment variable
  - Set CVSS threshold to 7
- `.circleci/config.yml`:
  - Updated cache keys to v3 (forces fresh cache, fixes Gradle jar corruption)
  - Changed "dwh-lambdas-build-cache-v2" → "dwh-lambdas-build-cache-v3"
  - Changed "dwh-lambdas-owasp-build-cache-v1" → "dwh-lambdas-owasp-build-cache-v2"
- `OWASP_FIX_README.md`: Complete setup guide and troubleshooting

## Action Required
**CRITICAL**: An NVD API key must be added to CircleCI for this to work properly.

### Steps:
1. Request API key from: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
2. Add to CircleCI: Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Name: `NVD_API_KEY`
   - Value: <your-api-key>
3. Ensure the `dataworks-common` context has access to this variable

Without the API key, the OWASP check will be extremely slow (30+ minutes) 
and may timeout.

## Testing
After adding the NVD API key to CircleCI:
- First run will take 10-15 minutes (downloads NVD database)
- Subsequent runs will take 2-5 minutes (uses cache)
- Review dependency-check report for any vulnerabilities

## Breaking Changes
None - the upgrade is backward compatible. The only requirement is adding 
the NVD API key to CircleCI environment variables.
